About

Tenzies is a number / dice game implemented in ReactJS. While Creating this project I learned Event Listeners in React, React State, Conditional Rendering in React, React Hooks(useEffect), etc. A player can track the number of rolls, current time and the best rolls and best time it took to win the game.The player can validate their answers and play as many times as they want.
